Trade Assets Tokenization with smart tokens in coreum

What is Trade Inclusive
Trade Inclusive is a MSME ( Micro Small and Medium Enterprises ) Financial Inclusivity Platform to demonstrate their compliance - financial , EXIM and ESG, creditworthiness and their best practices, while the financiers are looking for transparency to enter the trade finance asset class. Trade Inclusive is a platform to enable this transparency and provenace to broaden the financial options for the MSMEs.

Problem statement :
The MSMEs have a big barrier to transend to the financiers ( both traditional and defi ), to demonstrate their compliance - Finanncial , KYC, Vesrt practices , EXIM, ESG. The Financiers on the other side are looking for the transparency to evaluate the fideliy of these asset classes for trade finance, and this gap is high and is widening.
Per WTO Aug 2022, only 50% of the trade financing needs - rejection rate of 50% are met even in developed countries, as opposed to a rejection rate of 7% for big companies. The situation is far worse in developing nations. MSMEs run the grand share of global supply chains including cross border trade. They also employ the vulnerable population.

In Asia the trade financing gap is estimated at 700 B a year, and in India the data indicates that more than 70% of the MSMEs are still in informal section. Most of these MSMEs are Owner/Workers and they typically represent occupations tagged as Geographic Indicators, preserving the heritage of the local specialities and making them available for exports = argi and food, to textiles to neutraceuticals etc.

The institutional financiers and the financial markets want to enter this space, but the lack of visibility and ways to identify high quality assets for trade financing is a big detterent for them. For Exporters and Importers, mutual unknowns, opaque steps and data discrepencies ( some reports indicate at 80% ), are not conducive for investment grade assets. 

This is because of opaque proceses and paper documents as documents of title, where the bearer needs to have the paper document to release cargo at the port of delivery ( or indemnification letters there of ) add lots of intermediaries and inefficiencies in the process. Even the electronic attempts of the documents have not solved the reconciliation needs. These assets are as good as money for the bearer, and should be much more liquid, and be enablers for the MSMEs to access finance and working capital. Currently, the system is skewed towards a few big buyers.

Solution :

Recently, there have been bills in UK, giving legal status to these documents to be comparrable to their paper counterparts. This opens up potential for many ways to . Trade Inclusive team members have been wokring with many trade organizations, governments and MSMEs to study the issues and advise progressive steps.

Trade Inclusive is a DLT solution that tokenizes the supply chain documents for financing ( predominantly ) Cross-Border , with specific implementatiosn for structured and conclusive change of ownership of the document of title ( Bill of Lading ), and the Commercial Accounts Receivables for the Exporter MSMEs. Thease along with the other documents that can be shown for referential integrity reduces discrepencies and uncertainity , offers counter party de-risking and opens up the space for many creative programmable Deliver versus Pay, situations that brodens the financial access for MSMEs.

The team has realized that the solution needs multiple levels of capabilities accross chains, and have been assembling the architecture to be able to achieve the ideal set of characteristics. This includes solutions which have specific capabiltiies in cross border payments like XRPL, and also needing to integrate with enterprise assets for re-conciliations through oracles, and other adapters with business logic that needs to be encoded in smart contracts. The coreum platforms smart token functonality and AssetNFT and their extensions have been tried out for the first round of proofs for the usecase, and additional potential features that might be needed are being discovered.

There are specific programs like Open Account Trade for Negotiable BLs, that can potentially get better prices and early settlement for Exporters, and also as part of BUY-SELL marketplace for NFTS for negotiable BLs.

For Non-Negotiable BLs, the Expoter and Importer can get in to dynamic discounting ( and more continous forms of it ).

Also, these solutions make it attactive for financiers as they see the traceabiltiy and the de-risking and can identify high reliablity assets for their financing markets and potential aggegations for bigger investments.

The solution is ### Problem statement :specifially geared towards Exporter/ Importer source of truth, privacy protected verifyable credentials for business practices and document of title ownership for operational purposes.
